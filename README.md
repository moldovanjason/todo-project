this todo-project is simply just that, a todo list to add items with your daily tasks.
there is no backend involved so the tasks are not store anywhere after the page is refreshed.

This project is used up of alot of react hooks to store whats in the input for when your first create a todo and when you edit one.
using differnt hooks like useEffect and useRef to focus on input when page is refreshed or when todo is submitted or updated.
imported react-icons for editing and delete ui.
Used the spread operator in react to display previous todos while adding new ones.
